# planner
//pseudo code:
I need to get a layout for the calendar-bootstrap
make a function to display all the rows
get date and times in proper slots
make time slots have input textboxes and a save button--save to local storage
row of current hour will have different color than the rest
lastly make it pretty

//Objective
This is a day planner from 9am to 5pm. User will be able to input text of appointments or to-do's and save o local storage. The current hour will be a different color to make user aware of time and saved appointments.

//Structure
I created the table with all html. 

//Issues
I had a hard time getting the text to display and save.
